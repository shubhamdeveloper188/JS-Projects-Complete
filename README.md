# JavaScript Projects Repository 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript Projects** collection!  
This repository contains multiple small-to-medium projects built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** to strengthen my frontend development skills.  

Each project demonstrates practical use of **JavaScript concepts** such as DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage, and API integration — all essential for real-world development and technical interviews.
