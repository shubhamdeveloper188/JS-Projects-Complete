# 🌦️ Weather App

A simple **Weather Application** built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, which fetches **real-time weather data** from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  

This project was created as part of my journey to strengthen **JavaScript fundamentals** and practice **API integration** — skills that are also highly relevant in **automation testing** (handling async data, validating responses, and updating DOM dynamically).

## 🚀 Features
- 🌍 Search weather by city name  
- 🌡️ Displays **temperature**, **humidity**, **wind speed**, and **weather icon**  
- ⚠️ Error handling for invalid city names  
- 📱 Responsive design for different devices  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** → Structure of the app  
- **CSS3** → Styling & responsive UI  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** → Logic, DOM manipulation, event handling  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** → Real-time weather data

## 📖 Concepts Practiced
- **Fetch API** with Async/Await  
- **DOM Manipulation** → dynamically updating UI elements  
- **Event Handling** → search button, input field  
- **Error Handling** → invalid inputs and API errors  
- **Responsive Design** with CSS

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened my **JavaScript fundamentals** (functions, events, conditionals)  
- Learned how to **fetch data from an external API** and display it on the UI  
- Gained experience in **debugging async code** — directly applicable to **automation testing tools like Playwright & Cypress**  
- Improved UI/UX thinking with clean, responsive design
