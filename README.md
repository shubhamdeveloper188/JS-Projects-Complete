# 🚀 JavaScript Projects Complete

Welcome to my **JavaScript Projects Repository**!  
This repo contains multiple beginner-to-intermediate level projects built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  

As a **QA Engineer transitioning into Automation Testing**, I built these projects to sharpen my **JavaScript fundamentals**, which are essential for writing strong test automation frameworks with tools like **Playwright, Cypress, and Selenium**.  

Each project demonstrates **core JS concepts**, **problem-solving skills**, and **frontend logic** — giving me hands-on coding practice that directly improves my automation expertise.

## 🔑 Key Learnings
Through these projects, I strengthened my skills in:
- **JavaScript Fundamentals** → DOM, events, arrays, objects, conditionals  
- **Asynchronous JavaScript** → Fetch API, Promises, Async/Await  
- **API Integration** → Currency & Weather apps with real-time data  
- **Data Persistence** → localStorage for saving state  
- **Game Logic** → condition-based coding and user interaction handling  
- **Frontend Development Basics** → responsive UI with HTML/CSS  

These same skills directly apply to **automation testing**, where I’ll be writing **JavaScript/TypeScript-based test scripts**, handling **async APIs**, and verifying **dynamic DOM states**.
